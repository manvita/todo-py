This is a command based TODO list program written in python.
Why one more TODO program?
    As a practice on using the command based dispatcher.
    Although this is in python, I guess that in C++ would be similar.
    I would like to add all kinds of functionality to it.

TODO list program :
Functionalities needed :
Function to add task : A task is a list that has a unique index,
a task string, due date, importance and tag(s) attached to it.
Function to modify a task, ,it's due date or importance or the string or tags
Function to sort the task based on due date or importance or both
Function to say that a task has been completed with the time of completion

The program is at todo.py
Uses the cmd module to recursively take input
